	{
		a.Items.Add(i);
	}

	for(int i = 0; i<10; i++)
	{
		a.Items.Remove(i);
	}	

    What is the problem with this code?

15. What is the problem in below code? How to solve the problem?
class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int position = 1;           
            List<int> list = new List<int>();

            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
            {
                list.Add(i);
            }

            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
            {       
                //remove elements from even positions
                list.RemoveAt(position);
                position++;
            }
        }
    }

Throws System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException. Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection.
Parameter name: index
To correct the problem use  
	    for (int i = 0; i < list.Count; i++)
            {
                //remove elements from even positions
                list.RemoveAt(position);
                position++;
            }

16. What are the various uses of Using keyword in C#? Is it possible to use Using statement with any object, e.g., using(MyClass obj =MyClass()){...}

17. Can you tell how to design below method? Use same method to display contents of stack,queue, arraylist

     void M1(...) //should be allowed to pass any collection objects like ArrayList, List, Stack, Queue, etc
	{
		//Print each elements of collection
	}

Ans:  void M1(ICollection coll) //need to pass ICollection type
        {
            foreach (var item in coll)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item); 
            }
        }

18. Suppose you have elements in an array of elements with values 0 and 1 say int [] intArr = {0,1,0,1,0,1,1}; How do we sort the elements with
a single for loop and without using any other collection or array?

19. Verify the flag bit in position 3 from MSB in a byte.
    bool function f(byte x)
	{
		.............
	} 

Ans:
bool function f(byte x)
	{
		byte y = 
	} 
Why do we need Finalizer if we implement Dispose pattern?

what is Difference beetween Array and Hash Table.? 



How do you unit test a private method? What are the different ways?

Suppose you have a base class A. B and C are derived from class A. Class B also related with class A with a has-a (aggregation) relationship. 
Class A has virtual method say print(). This Print() method is overridden in class B and C? Show this in UML class diagram. Write the skeleton code
in C# showing the implementation of this class diagram.

Suppose you have a base class A. B and C are derived from class A. Class A has virtual method say print(). This Print() method is overridden in 
class B and C? Explain how runtime polymorhism exists with virtual table (vtable).

Suppose you get a runtime error in constructor of class A. How do you inform consumer of class A that error has occurred? Explain the advantages of 
each one. What should be the most optimised solution/best practice?

Show how the stack looks like when below code is executed? What are the differences between stack and heap data structure?
public class A
{
	void Print(int x) {Console.Write(x);}
}

public class MainClass
{
	static void Main()
	{
		A a = new A();
		a.Print(5);
	}
}

What are the different collections available in .NET? How do you decide which collection is best for a given scenario in terms of performance? 

What is the difference between Dictionary and Hashtable. How to decide which one to use?
or, Why Dictionary is preferred over hashtable in C#? 

What would happen if you add an item to list object while iterating through the items in for loop and printing the value? Is it going to print the 
added item or thrw exception while iterating? 
class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int position = 1;           
            List<int> list = new List<int>();

            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
            {
                list.Add(i);
            }

            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
            {       
                //add an element
                list.Add(position);
                position++;
            }
        }
    }

as properties.

Write code for below requirement.
"You have class A. A has to notify another class B every 1 sec about the time change. B has to get the changed time from A and then print the time."

What is the difference between API, system call and function/method?

Write a function static string Space(string s) {...} that returns the string with added space between each character. ex. "FRED" should be obtained as 
"F R E D".
