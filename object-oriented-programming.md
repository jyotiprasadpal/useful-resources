## Object oriented programming concepts

- What are the different techniques of reusing code?
You have below inheritance. Golffish is new type wand it can only swim. How to solve this problem?
    
    Animal
      | eat(),walk()   
--------------          GoldFish  
Person      Dog               swim()
      
- You've engine, tyre, door class. Use them to design car type. [Hint: use dependency injection]

- You've a table fan and a ceiling fan. How do you model it using OOP principles.

- ive an example where LSP is violated.

- What are the differences between procedure-oriented languages and object-oriented languages?

Procedure Oriented Language:
PO Language is fully concentrates on Procedures/functions/methods. It normally works as a 
sequence of actions as seen in flowchart or in any algorithm. It follows top-down approach. It totally focuses on methods and not the data which is utilized by methods. In PO languages if data is used by many methods then its declared as global data but there is a problem if we do that, what is that, if we forgot or by mistake if we consume that data in some other method than it comes with problem. Mostly these scenarios happen in large systems. 

Example: COBOL, PASCAL, C, FORTRAN etc. 

Object Oriented Language:
OO concepts says it thinks about data and binds that data and methods those are manipulating that data into one entity known as object and then utilize that object into system. It uses bottom up approach.

Example: C++, Java, C#, VB.Net etc. 

There are some fundamental concepts of OO Language which a language has to follow to be a truly OO language. 

• OBJECT
• CLASS
• ABSTRACTION
• ENCAPSULATION
• DATA HIDING / INFORMATION HIDING
• INHERITANCE
• POLYMORPHISM
